# Disclaimer
This repository documents my research progress. I wanted to understand the necessary signal processing and control theory algorithms behind such a device. 

The FFB pedal is a robot and can be dangerous. Please watch [The Terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator) before continuing. If not interacted with care, it may cause harm. I'm not responsible for any harm caused by this design suggestion. Use responsibly and at your own risk.

| Software (firmware, SimHub plugin, ...) |https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal |

# Features
## Control of pedal parameters
To tune the pedal parameters, a SimHub plugin was developed, which communicates with the pedal over USB.

## Effects
Currently ABS, TC and RPM vibration are supported effects. The SimHub plugin communicates with the pedal and triggers game effects as parameterized.The effects and its description can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/wiki/Pedal-Effects).

## Servo tuning
The used microcontroller has software to communicate with the used iSV57 servo. Therefore, it can tune the servos PID loop and read certain servo states like position, torque, power. 

## Joystick data stream
The joystick/gamepad data is provided via three redundant channels
1) Bluetooth
2) 0V-3.3V output analog signal. Can be read by e.g. https://gp2040-ce.info/. The pin 25 was used for analog output.
3) vJoy gamecontroller (only available when SimHub runs, also need enable control map plugin).

To provide native USB HID output, development with ESP32 S3 started, it's working, but not stable yet, [see](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/9582#issuecomment-2219722111).

# Software

## ESP32 code

### Architecture
A Doxygen report of the sources can be found [here](https://chrgri.github.io/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/Arduino/html/index.html).

### Install ESP32 driver
The drivers can be found here [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

### Firmware generation and flashing
Firmware can be built and flashed via VS Code. Prebuilt binaries can be flashed e.g. via ESP32 webflasher.

#### Built from source (via VS Code)
See this [guide](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/wiki/VScode-IDE-setup).

#### Flash prebuilt binaries via web flasher
The binaries are available [here](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/releases). They can be flashed via the ESP [webflasher](https://esp.huhn.me/). Another [Webflasher](https://nabucasa.github.io/esp-web-flasher/).

## iSV57T-130 servo config tuning
The iSV57T allows parameter tuning via its RS232 interface. To tune the servo towards this application, I executed the following [steps](StepperParameterization/StepperTuning.md).

With the current [PCB](Wiring/Esp32_V3) design, the ESP can directly communicate with the iSV57T servo. Manual tuning as described before isn't necessary anymore. A description of the steps I undertook to decode the communication protocol can be found on the Disord server. Additional features such as sensorless homing and lost-step recovery were developed and integrated with the help of this communication.

## SimHub plugin:
The SimHub plugin was designed to communicate with the ESP to (a) modify the pedal configuration, e.g. the force vs. travel parameterization and (b) to trigger effects such as ABS oscillations.  

![image](SimHubPlugin/Images/Plugin-UI.png)

To install the plugin, the plugin [DiyActivePedal.dll](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/releases) has to be copied to the SimHub directory, e.g. C:/Program Files (x86)/SimHub

# Steps after flashing the firmware
The pedal will not move initially after flashing. One has to open the SimHub plugin, connect to the pedal, and send a config with non-zero PID values.
Recommended PID values are:

```
P=0.2-0.4
I=50-150
D=0
```

After sending the initial config, power cycling of the pedal is necessary. The pedal should move afterward.


# Error handling
## Pedal doesn't move after initial setup
1. Make sure, that you follow the above instructions. The default PID values are set to 0 thus the pedal will not move. You have to send non-zero PID values and restart the pedal to observe pedal travel.
2. Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE, set the baud rate to 921600, and restart the pedal. You should see some debug info. Make a screenshot and kindly ask the Discord server for help.

## Bluetooth doesn't show gamepad data
Install DirectX 9

## The serial monitor shows a message "Couldn't load config from EPROM due to version mismatch"
Install a SimHub plugin matching the ESP firmware you installed and send a config to the pedal.

## The com port showed access denied or can not connect
Check the arduino plugin scan setting, please use scan only specfiec port as below.<br>
